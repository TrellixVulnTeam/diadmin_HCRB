# SAP Data Intelligence admin Tools

This contains a collection of short scripts most using [System Management Command-Line Client (vctl)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/41b069490705457e9426b112a3f052bd/Cloud/en-US/b13e0b4fe2574b3881e3c7ef1ad2a640.html) that helps me in the daily business of managing SAP Data Intelligence Cloud instance. 

This is still a personal github repository although public. Everyone can use it but I am not able to give you any support. Maybe later this will be moved to the oficial SAP-samples git.
